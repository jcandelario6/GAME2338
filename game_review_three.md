## Summary

  This game is about starting an adventure as a pokemon trainer that travels the world capturing different kinds of pokemon and leveling up
pokemon by battling other wild pokemon or pokemon trainers to become stronger, also to challenge yourself to fight against the most strongest
pokemon trainers in the game. In Pokemon Diamond, the story takes place in a region called Sinnoh where many different pokemon exist, there
players are tasked with training their pokemon, fighting in the Sinnoh Leauge Championship, and traveling the world of Sinnoh while making
their Pokemon stronger. The player will either start as an assined girl or boy that lives in the region and will start their adventure as
a Pokemon trainer, the player will be allowed to name their chosen character and choose which of the three Sinnoh based starter pokemon
they will choose to travel. Once they have chosen, the players will travel Sinnoh to capture pokemon, create a team and battle against 
many other pokemon trainers (NPC's) who have the same exact goal as you do. In this game it will give players the chance to experience the
wonders of being a pokemon trainer from the popular brand and series Pokemon, and in this game the player will be going against major enemies
that will affect the story of the protagonist.
  In the darkness lurks an organization that wants to take over the world called Team Galactic, their mission is to capture and control the 
legendary pokemon of Sinnoh that have the ability to control time and space called Dialga and Palcia, with these two pokemon they will
have the power to change the world into Team Galactics image. In parts of the story, the player will come across some Team Galactic goons
who are terrorising other people and out of the kindness of the main characters heart he/she decides to stop Team Galactic and battle against
them. In the first parts of the story the player will fight Team Galactic because of small disputes with the citizens of Sinnoh, but in 
the future, the player will have to fight Team Galactic that may change the fate of Sinnoh and the world. That is why it is important for 
the player to fight against many pokemon and trainers in order to become stronger and continue the story of the game, because if the player
is not strong enough then the player will not be able to unlock new area's of the world or fight or catch other pokemon too. It is important
to fight and train their pokemon so that they may be able to proceed through the games level, and luckily there are many ways to proceed
in the game.
  This game is a top down game that focuses on character to move in different directions while looking from above the character in order
to see the map, but even if the player will move the character while staying somewhere near the middle of the map, the player will not
be able to see what they are approaching until it comes into view of their screen. So it is important that since the camera is in a third
person view the player must be careful and remember where they are going, but the player may have a map but they only have a map of the 
Sinnoh region and not a map of the area the player will be. Even so, another fun feature is that everything that you may want to find is
organized neatly in your menu option, including where you store your team of pokemon and when you fight with your pokemon the battle choices
are easy to find and use when you want to attack, switch pokemon, use a item on your pokemon or run away from a wild pokemon. Other than
that it is important to continue on the path you are given in order to continue the game and talk to other people so that you may obtain
more and new items and information later in the game. In conclusion, Pokemon Diamond is one of the top down games that allows people to
focus on the many wonders and adventures of becoming a Pokemon Trainer while going against great challenges and unkown experiences that may unlock legendary myths.

## Final Thoughts

A few facts about Pokemon Diamond is that this is one of the older games from the pokemon series, but even so it has not lost its charm in playing content; while the more that a few problems arise in the game just like the old contents of the Pokemon game series that decreases the mechanics of the game. Like first of all, in the game the player must make sure that they have a Pokemon that can learn specific TM moves that correspond with that Pokemons type, because these specific moves are used in order to advance the game and sadly those moves become of your pokemon's battle roster forever so the player can never switch out the move. The second reason is that since its an old game the graphic quality of the game is just like any other pixelated game back in the early 2000's so not many people in the year 2020 that just started getting into Pokemon are looking to buy a copy.
