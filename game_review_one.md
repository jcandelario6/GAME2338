# Game Review for Assassin's Creed Oddysey

## Details

### Game Title 
Assassin's Creed Oddysey, English, https://assassinscreed.ubisoft.com/game/en-us/home.

### Rating
I Rate games from 1 to 10, and I rate this game a 8.

## Summary
This game is about going back to the past of Ancient Greek and not only getting involved with historical battles back in greece, 
but also uncovering the agenda of an ancient organization and what they want with the main characters. In Assassin's Creed 
Oddysey a player will have the chance to choose one of the two main characters of the game and proceed the game as that character,
once the player chooses their character the other main character will play another role in the future of the game. Then the goal
of the game is to progress into the game in order to reveal the secret of the main characters past long ago, but during the story
there will be creatures and places never seen in real life, but only told in Greek Mythology. In order to complete the game the 
main character must uncover the truth, fight a cult, creatures of mythology, greek armies (Athens and Spartens) and must face the 
main characters past.

## Final Thoughts
This game is one of my favorites, because not only was I pulled into the Assassin's Creed franchise, I also love that it take us
into past lives where we see how people used to live all those years ago.
## Additional Information
This game is special, because it also mixed in a choice function where what you choose affects the story or a side mission, this
game is all about assisting the player to make their own story in the game, by allowing them to choose what they'll do in the game
and then take action just like the old assassin's creed games.
