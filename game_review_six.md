## Summary

This game is about 4 to 8 players competing with one another on a board game based battle field in order to achieve victory against
one another. The players start the game by choosing their avatars or game pieces in this manner and use their game pieces navigate
through the board during their own turns, to make it more interesting the game developers made the game pieces look like human
like rag dolls so that they may add extra effects. Each turn the players roll a dice to see how many spaces they have to move and 
move throughout the boards spaces to the amount they roll and keep going like this for each player until every player had a turn.
Scattered in different locations of the board are chests that give a golden chalice to the player who lands on the chest space 
and unlocks it. In order to win the game players must take turns, fight, compete, and interfere with the other players in order
to obtain golden chalices, the victor of the game is the one who gets the most limited amount of golden chalices first.

To give an edge to the game, Pummel Party also has special features that will help players to advance in the game and interfere with one another in order for them to work together to take down an opposing enemy or to steal victory from their enemies. The board game is set in a form of a desert/harbor location and each space represent a different icon that can help or hurt the players. All players start on the blank space and there are different kinds of space like the key space that gives away keys to the player who lands on it, skull space which can be purchased by the player who lands on it (any other player lands on a purchased space must pay keys to the owner), 
prize space when a random item is given to the player, health space which gives the player health, the exclamation space which
raises red water that will damage any players inside the water, and the chest space which players must pay keys to open in order 
to obtain the golden chalice. In the game there are also special side games that the players compete in after every round, in these
side games the players fight against various games with different rules and find out what place they are in when it comes to 1st
to 8th place, after the side game depending on the players ranking the players must take their turn depending on their ranking
and their turns change every time after each round depending on their ranking. Not only that depending on their ranking they get
a different item which can also be obtained on a prize space, there are different items that can switch places with other players,
protect players from damage, deal damage to other players, or move players extra spaces. When it comes to health and damage, all
players have equal health bars and players are able to deal damage to each other with items in order to kill the players and 
send them to a penalty zone, this zone may keep them away from the goal depending on the location they are at (they can get back
in the game when its their turn).

When it comes to Pummel Party, the players have to compete against each other on various mini games and use what items they have at their disposal in order to throw off their opponents and win the game. Even if the players have to set up traps or attack their enemies to reach the goal first, anything goes in order to obtain the reward for the win. Each player must show no mercy so that they can obtain an advantage in the upcoming rounds, because winning each mini game is crucial so that the player who wins gets an advantage by going first on the board game and obtain an item that is incredibly rare, mostly an item that can switch an player with another player that is closer to the goal that the player needs to be or take out somebody who is a threat to the game. Even so, to make it fair for all players each player has a chance to see the whole board before they move and what items they can use before rolling to see what they will decide to do, which will decide the outcome of each of their moves. When it comes to Pummel Party, it is a turn-based game which makes each player must be cautious, yet bold with their moves and crush their enemies in their path to steal victory.

## Final Thoughts

Pummel Party is a turn-based game that requires players to play mini games to decide the players turns of the round, even so it will become bothersome if some of the players are experts at the every mini games or the Pummel Party itself, then the turn-based function will be useless and the winner will always get rare items. Even so, this game is a perfect multiplayer game to go against other people that players know and will create funny moments when it comes to interfering with each other and never know what will happen when it comes to the players turns and which items they will use to create opportunities for themselves. But just like any board games, this specific game requires real people to play the game which will take time to find other players, but luckily Pummel Party has the option to find online players to play, but thats only if their are people who play Pummel Party anyways.
