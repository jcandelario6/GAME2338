## Game One: Assassin's Creed Brotherhood
In the gaming franchise, Assassin's Creed like this game have become very popular and the gameplay and functions of how you start the game
look fine, but this game also has its perks. Just like any other game, there have been minor bugs and gliches that have been seen in the
game lately, like for example when the player tries to perform a leap of faith, but insteads just jumps off the roof to their deaths. Even
though situations like these still occur in the game they are not stopped, because many people don't mind hilarious gliches like that and
the game still functions how its supposed to be. What is important is that the game stay's popular and that players will continue the game
series the way that it was programmed, and with the new functions that have been added and improved in the game, more and more players are
getting into the game. While it may be true that people like the franchise, this game is still created a couple of years ago and since
more people are getting into the new Assassin's Creed games, this version is being sold at a low price.

## Game Two: Red Dead Redemption 2
This product takes players back to the western era, and creators have made the free world incredibly large that it feels like the plains
go on forever. To enjoy the game, the player must survive in the world from bandits, the law, and even hunger; this game is a special kind
that depends on the player to take care of the main character with any daily necessities and these functions make the players think that
they are actuall outlaws in the wild west. Even though this game is new, there have been sightings that a players horse was actually
turning different collors and the players wardrobe was acting up at different times. There are still glitches, but this game is still new

## Game Three: Left 4 Dead 2
Just like the others, this game is an action packed video game, but instead of free worlds this game focuses on players to go solo or
multiplayer and survive during a zombie apocalypse. When a player looks at the game, like the trailer it makes someone want to buy it
because of horror, action, and quality it looks at first, but after someone plays it, the game doesn't look a lot like the trailer when it
comes to quality. The Left 4 Dead 2 game is also a old game, almost like Assassin's Creed brotherhood, because of that players can get the
games disc or online for a low price. Even though the game is old the functions of the game still work and it allows the people to
properly play the game without many disturbances. This game is a survival and fast pace game that requires the cooperation of all players
to work together or decide to go off alone and due to the new abilites and functions this game included many more people are interested
