## Summary

This game is about a man name Shaun who just in one night loses his daughter, somebody who he loved with all his heart due to the chaos that
occured during the start of the outbreak. As Shaun and his brother were trying to escape from the town they lived in, they were chased by
a horde of zombies a long with a massive panicing crowd of people, but when Shaun and his daughter got close to escaping they were shot by
a soldier who was given the order to kill them; Shauns brother was able to knock out the soldier and save Shaun but his daughter was shot
and killed. Years later many events have transpired that sent the world to dividing with each other because of the zombies, military, and
a revoluntionary army that fights against the military called the fireflies. After more than 10 years Shaun works as a mercenary and takes 
on jobs hunting people down, bodyguard work, or searching for goods and materials; on his latest job he accepts an offer from the fireflies
to escort a little girl named Ellie to where the fireflies are based at, but Ellie was very special because her body holds the key to the cure
of the virus. Together with Ellie they fight and survive against zombies, miltitary, and scavengers in order to reach the fireflies
safely, but during the travel Shaun starts to get close to Ellie like in a father figure sort of way and becomes attached to her,
but he knew that he couldn't stay with her forever. Finally when they reached the fireflies after they traveled a great distance from one
city to the next they were going to use the little girl to create the cure, but apparently the cure will have to be created with the cost
of the Ellie's life; grown attached to her for so long Shaun fought against the fireflies and stole her away and escaped with her, now
they went into hiding to make sure that Ellie is safe.

When it comes to the story it is great, because it takes us to the experience on how they became so close to each other and what kind of 
ordeals they had to go through. Another thing is that since this is a remastered format, the graphics of the game is far better that the 
first production of the game from 2013, especially if the game is using a off camera format where the player will be able to see the character
and surroundings in front of the character. The game allows the player to see a large area in front of the character so that they respond
to any changes of the CPU's in front of them and since this is a Apocalypse shooter game it gives them more of a scope on how to react.
The problem is that the character will have to be careful from behind, because there is no compass that points to where the enemies are, but
there is a sound spectrum on the character which will warn you that an enemy is close to you in the opposite direction. Another thing that
the character has is the ability to sneak and listen to enemies from far away and pin point their location, sadly this ability is better
facing zombie enemies and when it comes to humans it will only pin point their location when they are talking and only for a limited time
after they are speaking.

Going back to the main characters, Shaun is a perfect character that distances himself from people due to the loss of his daughter and become
hateful, but when it comes to Ellie she tries to get a long with Shaun but get into fights most of the time. Due to experience 
and watching each others back, trust forms and soon they start to get a long with each other little by little and so much that they start
to see each other as a father and daughter figure. Even so their main objective is survival and to survive Shaun and Ellie must know how
to fight, shoot, scavenge, sneak, and use whatever they have at their disposal to get through any problem that gets in their way, and to 
do that the players are given a back pack where they can craft items like explosives, weapon upgrades, molotoves, and med kits. By crafting
items players can use these items to get through different situations, not only that they can also improve their characters and their weapons
they can only do that by using a bench that are scattered around the world to improve their weapon stats and medicine to improve their physical
stats. Of course in order to make all these improvements and crafting is to look around the area the players is in and scavenge for materials
that can make the improvements or craft.

## Final Thoughts

The Last of Us is a great game when it comes to survival by giving us a puzzel based situations and allowing players to think for themselves
to figure out how to survive. It is important to think about what the player should do, because they could either sneak by their enemies 
and pick them off one at a time, set traps, or fight through your enemies, but the problem is you will never know when you will need your
ammo and it will be a waste to use a lot of your ammo because to is hard to find ammo if you don't search for it and ammo is scarce so you
can't fight all the time. Another thing is that when collecting items that can improve your weapon and physical stats are tricky, because
the player will not be able to improve all stats in weapons or physically unless you start a new game that allows you to keep your stats
after completing the main story, the player will have to determine which stats they will improve and use those stats to survive the game.
I also don't like that when your trying to sneak around people that are alive that you can't pin point their location easily like zombies,
because you never know when they are next to you or if they are going to show up behind you. Just like any other game I don't like it when 
it goes my way, because there have been cases where a proffesional is able to move at the right times to beat their enemies and and sneak 
by them at the right moment, but in the end you fail and show yourself which ends up in a big fight where you waste your supplies.
