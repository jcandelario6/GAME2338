## Summary

This game is about a tournament or battle based gameplay that allows players to fight against many character icons that are
branded by Nintendo. In the game there will be characters from Nintendo like the Mario brothers, Sonic, Metro Exodus, Pokemon
Kirby, and many other Nintendo game including a few characters from these games other than the main characters as well. In the
game each character of the Super Smash has been programmed to be balanced when it comes to their characteristices, but to also 
have a chance at being equally strong as the other characters, even if they characters are not viewed as a strong character to play as.
As to fighting, the characters will be both strong and interesting to use and find out how each of them will fare on different
fighting arena's and the extra content that will be shown in the gameplay. Supers Smash Bros Brawl is a side scrolling game that 
allows players to either fight in a arena type field against one another in order to find out which one of them is the stongest 
in Super Smash Bros, or the players can play the story mode of a side scrolling adventure and fight many different enemies and 
find out how the characters come together in the first place.

In the different gameplay options, players will have the chance to either fight against one another in a Brawl fighting format
or fight together as in the Story fighting format. When it comes to a Brawl, players go to a character roster where they will
be able to choose which Nintendo character they will be fighting and within the roster each character also has the option to change
the characters colors or outfits they have been suited with in the Brawl. When players fight in a Brawl they have the option to
change the gameplay options, and what that means is that there are different ways to fight in a Brawl, like in on format the players
have a limited number of lives and they fight one another until they get rid of their opponents lives, or another format is that
they continue fighting and knocking each other out until the time limit and the one who got knocked out the least wins. The other
game format for Super Smash Bros Brawl is the story mode, where the character(s) take on a character a fight together against
enemies that show up from the right side of your screen and you or both of you continue to side scroll to the right until you
come to the end of the area. Since this a story mode, players will be continuosly going to different groups of characters that are
shown on the roster and play as them, not to mention during the story they player(s) will have to fight against other NPC Nintendo
characters or against special Nintendo characters where you won't be able to play on the Brawl roster.

Other special perks of the game is that during the Brawl format there will be objects that will appear randomly on the stadium
and come from out of know where during the battle, not just before the battle players can decide which items will appear during
the brawl like hammers that can deal massive damage, laser guns that deal long range damage, traps that can be used to do all
variety of things like damage, bounce, or trap, and etc. Another special feature of a Brawl battle is the Super Smash Orb, which
is a orb with the Super Smash logo that appears and moves around during a Brawl at a random time; if a player destroys the orb,
the person who destroyed it has the chance to use their characters special move that does an attack or effect that is unique to
that character. Now during the Story format gameplay, the player(s) will go against enemies that are well known in Mario games
like Goomba's and Koopa Troopa's, but mostly player(s) will go against enemies called shadow creatures that are unique to the
Super Smash Bros Brawl game. There are different shadow creatures that the player(s) will face like regular shadow warriors which
are the same size as the characters, but easy to beat, brutes who are bigger to defeat and deal more damage, one eyed shadows 
floating enemies, shadows that can take the form of a Nintendo character, and many other shadows that are unique to handle. In Super
Smash Bros Brawl, it is created where the player(s) will be able to fight against new and interesting enemies and change up the 
playstyle ruling to make it more fun, it also gives the player(s) a change to play this game just like the retro Nintendo games
usually play, but in a stadium based side scrolling platform.

## Final Thoughts

For this game, it has a lot of features including changing the game format on what items can respawn on the battle field or how to change the time limit of the round in a multiplayer fight, but sadly not a lot of players would know about where the settings to change it are, not to mention the need to change it. That is because the default setting of a brawl is already fine with a group or pair to fight, since the battle will include random items, a smash ball orb, and the players continue to fight until the time limit runs out and the one with the least amount of knockouts wins. Due to the default setting not many players change it and when it comes to changing the settings, there is no tutorial that guides new players to the settings so that they can change the brawl round. Even so, there is a feature that this game has that a lot of people will judge about; in the character roster when players start the game for the first time, all the characters are not in the roster because this allows gamers to continue playing the game in order to collect the characters that can be released in the game. This feature is both fun and interesting due to the fact that in order to collect the characters the players must fight each other for random number of matches and then a random character comes a long where the player will have to fight against the unkown character and if they win, they can add the character to the roster.
