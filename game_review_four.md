## Summary

  This game is about the story of a pirate name Edward Kenway, who chases the dream of becoming rich, but soon out of no where finds himself getting between a
dispute that raged for many centuries, the Assassins Creed vs. the Templars because of this he will learn about what it means to be an 
Assassin. During Edwards adventure as a low pirate crewmate his allies attacked a Frenchman ship in order to steal their valuables, but 
not only were they attacking in a storm but they were also against an assassin who was sailing with them, when the ships capsized by the 
storm the only survivers were the assassin and Edward. In order to survive Edward had to fight against the assassin and was able to come
out victorious; Edward was able to find out what the assassin was sailing to so in his place he sailed to the people he would soon call 
enemies. At the location of the meeting, Edward was accepted by the members of the Templar order and was trusted by them when he completed
the jobs he was give, but becoming greedy to see what they have that is valuable he was instead caught by them and was taken on a slave ship.

## Final Thoughts

  This game creates a perfect experience for Assassins Creed fans to not only enjoy the series of the franchise, but also experience the life of an pirate who steals and plunders, but also who decides to join the Assassins Creed and their cause as well. So this game has many reasons to continue playing even after the story of the game, but since this was game that was created a couple of years ago by the video game company Ubisoft then there are going to be a few glitches that would cause funny moments. There have been moments in the game where npcs and objects have weird glitches like when the player kills a person in a certain way or touches their dead body then the npcs corpse starts to fidget its body or when the ships in the background start to move in different directions uncontrollably or sinks without no reason. Also in the world there many side quests where players can go to complete for achievements or money and resources, but there is one set of side quests that are incredbly hard for the player. These side quests are called Legend Ship quests because these side quests involve high level ships that are increbly hard to beat alone, especially this one area where there are two legendary ships and it would be impossible to defeat even if the player fully upgrades their ship.
