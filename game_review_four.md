## Summary

This game is about the story of a pirate name Edward Kenway, who chases the dream of becoming rich, but soon out of no where finds himself getting between a
dispute that raged for many centuries, the Assassins Creed vs. the Templars because of this he will learn about what it means to be an 
Assassin. During Edwards adventure as a low pirate crewmate his allies attacked a Frenchman ship in order to steal their valuables, but 
not only were they attacking in a storm but they were also against an assassin who was sailing with them, when the ships capsized by the 
storm the only survivers were the assassin and Edward. In order to survive Edward had to fight against the assassin and was able to come
out victorious; Edward was able to find out what the assassin was sailing to so in his place he sailed to the people he would soon call 
enemies. At the location of the meeting, Edward was accepted by the members of the Templar order and was trusted by them when he completed
the jobs he was give, but becoming greedy to see what they have that is valuable he was instead caught by them and was taken on a slave ship.
With an escape plan he used some of the same moves that he observed from the assassin he killed and was able to not only escape, but also
save other slaves from the many ships and stole a ship for himself, now free and prosperous he sails back to his old friends and continues
his life as a pirate.
