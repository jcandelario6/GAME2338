## Summary
This game is about assisting a farmer by using different kinds of plants to fight against hordes of zombies who want to reach the farmers
home and destroy his house. The mechanics of the game is simple, the battle area is basically a board where you are able to place plants
on the field so that they may take their positions and fight against zombies and the player must keep building the field and their strategy
in order to complete the waves. In the game there are draw backs, like the player must be wary of which plant they choose the place on the
field, because each and every one the plants have different features and abilities, the player must also be careful with spending sunlight
in the game the player obtains sunlight from the sun at different moments of time and must use that sunlight in order to obtain more plants,
but the plants each have a different price. Another thing is that the camera only shows the battle area and not where the zombies will attack
from and that is tricky, because the plants can only attack from a row like board game; that is another reason why players must be wary with
spending their sunlight. Just like the plants, sunlight is crucial with the game and must be handled carefully because if the player doesn't
think about how the wave will play out, it could lead to the players defeat.

It is important to make sure that understands the area and how it is laid out, because there are levels where some patches of land are blocked
off by weeds and the player would not be able to place any plants in that area. A situation like that could mean the weakness of your defense
and also limit your options on how you can protect yourself from a wave in that row. Just like a board game (Chess and Checkers), the player
must place his/her pieces where the enemies will not reach them and be able to protect themselves when the time is right, not to mention they
will have to think ahead to victory. Since the playing field is like a board game that limits the players camera options as well to predict
where and when the next attack is coming from and gives the zombies time to invade the board, so the player must also time their response
wisely.

Depending on the level the player chooses the level may be easy, medium or a hard ranking level, and because of the various levels developers
also included quirks in the games progression and keys of players interest in the game. The developers made this game very addicting to
people so that they may continue playing and become more interested in the Plants vs. Zombies games, a way the developers do that is by
using the level progression strategy. This type of strategy is nudge people to play the game by unlocking new weapons (plants) in order
to fight against the zombies in future levels or in the past levels, by also doing this it also allows people to unlock plants with new
abilities that may become more fun in the future levels. A lot of players continue to become more interested in games that allow people
to unlock more stuff in order to continue playing their favorite games and make them look forward for new game options and perks when they
continue to play. It is important for game companies to find more ways to get players and consumers to buy their games so that they can
sell more merchandise and not only with video games but also iconic franchise merch (shirts, hats, toys, etc...), because of this the
popularity of the game grows and the franchise as well.

## Final Thoughts
Plants vs. Zombies is a game that I could consider as a mini game and not one of those competitive video games that are more adored by the public, but it still is very popular to a lot of people who plays for the fun of it due to its puzzles and strategies. I do know for sure that this isn't a game that I would play all the time, but one that would be fun while playing when a console isn't involved, like on your tablet in bed or in the car during a trip. This tower defense based game was created for the mere entertainment of challenging yourself with new hordes and waves of zombies that are unpredictable the first time you play that level. One things for sure, this game is all about strategy on how to handle the level with what you already unlocked and to continue playing in order to unlock and achieve new and better plants for the game.
